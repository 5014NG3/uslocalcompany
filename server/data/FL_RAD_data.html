Although fully licensed in pest control, we treat only fire ants. Why? Fire ants kill. Fire ants (red ants) inject a venomous protein into the host causing allergic reactions and even anaphylactic shock. They are aggressive, territorial and vicious in the search for food. Fire ants chew on electrical wires causing costly damage and will invade virtually every inch of a property if not controlled. There is no natural enemy or predator for these non-native, invasive fire ants. Many pests can be controlled with a quick pest control killer or diverted by using preventative measures. We kill the colony from the inside out by sterilizing the queens. With our vast knowledge of fire ant behavior and with professional experience we can properly and safely control your fire ant infestations.
