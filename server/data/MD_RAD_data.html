LWRCI manufactures its own cold hammer-forged barrels to ensure the same high standards as our guns with a quality we can confidently stand behind. Each barrel is manufactured out of 41V45 steel alloy treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology. The cold hammer forging process compacts a gundrilled barrel blank over a mandrel using pressure rotary hammers. This forms a perfect rifling devoid of tool marks, stronger and denser than any other process. LWRCI barrels stand up better to extreme use than standard barrels without degradation of accuracy or loss of velocity. Our NiCorr™ surface conversion is permanently lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than hard chrome barrel surfaces.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#106;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#110;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#105;&#110;&#64;&#108;&#119;&#114;&#99;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">jbernstein@lwrci.com</a>","http://www.lwrci.com"
