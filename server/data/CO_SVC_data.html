We also distribute a unique Polyurethane coated Kevlar® line that can exist in hazardous environments and high abrasion mechanical applications. Our braided Spectra® lines are pre stretched and coated with a special polyurethane. This makes our Spectra® more durable and longer lasting than regular uncoated Spectra® products you can buy at kite stores and on line sellers.

Each TurboCoag® reactor treats 50 to 200 gallons per minute and eliminates up to 99.9% of contaminants in a single process step. For scalability several reactors can be chained together to treat more water. TurboCoag® uses electrochemistry to cost effectively compete with and replace chemical water treatment. TurboCoag® is low maintenance, offers continuous operation, has a small footprint, and effectively treats landfill leachate, produced oil, acid mine drainage, and many other wastewaters. TurboCoag® reduces customer OPEX for sludge disposal by 30-70%, chemical use by 70-95%, and biocide use by 100%. TurboCoag's patented design completely eliminates the issues of passivation and sludge buildup that affect legacy electrocoagulation designs while using less energy.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#46;&#107;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#110;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#97;&#118;&#105;&#118;&#105;&#100;&#119;&#97;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">tracy.kessner@avividwater.com</a>","www.avividwater.com"

Their customized selections are then packed in a beautiful gift box, and delivered directly to the recipient’s door. Sugarwish has basically flipped the gifting model, by allowing the recipient to choose what they receive, making it the first and only custom-curated gift of its kind. The interactive selection process successfully delivers that “kid in a candy store” feeling, from (virtually) anywhere, and has gained Sugarwish both recognition and a rapidly growing customer base.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#98;&#114;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#101;&#46;&#98;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#109;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#103;&#97;&#114;&#119;&#105;&#115;&#104;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">brooke.bearman@sugarwish.com</a>","https://sugarwish.com/"
