We use scientific methods and apply validated models from the cognitive and behavioral sciences to understand what underlies the performance of individuals, teams, and human-technology systems. We use assessment science principles to validly measure knowledge, skills, and aptitudes. We work with organizations and teams to develop tailored evaluation methods and metrics and we support subject-matter experts to develop the competency-based assessments they need for their learners and personnel.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#107;&#101;&#101;&#104;&#110;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#98;&#114;&#105;&#103;&#104;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#45;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">mkeehner@brighter-research.com</a>","brighter-research.com"
