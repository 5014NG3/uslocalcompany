For scalability several reactors can be chained together to treat more water. TurboCoag® uses electrochemistry to cost effectively compete with and replace chemical water treatment. TurboCoag® is low maintenance, offers continuous operation, has a small footprint, and effectively treats landfill leachate, produced oil, acid mine drainage, and many other wastewaters. TurboCoag® reduces customer OPEX for sludge disposal by 30-70%, chemical use by 70-95%, and biocide use by 100%.
