Of the many advanced materials known, only a select few have been made into HPF and, until now, there has been no generic process by which fibers from such materials could be formed. Thus far, the manufacture of a given HPF has required an ad-hoc process and unique technology platform that is usually not appropriate for other materials. Closely associated with these are long development times, unique technical challenges, major capital investments and significant development costs. All of these issues have inflated costs and held back growth of the HPF industry and industries dependent on it. Our objective is to change the game and make new fiber materials available to our customers – quickly and inexpensively.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#104;&#97;&#114;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#102;&#102;&#102;&#105;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">sharrison@fffibers.com</a>","http://www.fffibers.com"

This saves the construction market a lot of time and money. Our examination focuses mainly on the discrepancies between the various bid documents and the lack of planning.
