A key innovation behind Aloft's approach is a self-contained positioning and navigation technique that achieves micron-level localization and picosecond timing to maintain coherence across a baseline or series of baselines.  Enhanced sensing products include precise moving target geolocation, millimetric surface deformation, centimeter-level topography, and 3D volumetric reconstructions. Aloft's technique even extends to underwater synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) systems to enable undersea navigation while simultaneously mapping the sea floor.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#108;&#97;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#119;&#121;&#101;&#64;&#97;&#108;&#111;&#102;&#116;&#115;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">lauren.wye@aloftsensing.com</a>","www.aloftsensing.com"
