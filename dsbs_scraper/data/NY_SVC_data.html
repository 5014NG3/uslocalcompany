Of the many advanced materials known, only a select few have been made into HPF and, until now, there has been no generic process by which fibers from such materials could be formed. Thus far, the manufacture of a given HPF has required an ad-hoc process and unique technology platform that is usually not appropriate for other materials. Closely associated with these are long development times, unique technical challenges, major capital investments and significant development costs. All of these issues have inflated costs and held back growth of the HPF industry and industries dependent on it. Our objective is to change the game and make new fiber materials available to our customers – quickly and inexpensively.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#104;&#97;&#114;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#102;&#102;&#102;&#105;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">sharrison@fffibers.com</a>","http://www.fffibers.com"

Panasci Jr. Technology Entrepreneurship Competition. Using their $25,000 prize, the duo launched a technology startup, which they aptly named StudentVoice.  Within a few years, StudentVoice had become Campus Labs, and by 2008, the company had expanded to employ 30 at its downtown Buffalo office and serve 350 Member Campuses throughout the United States.

In 2012, the principals of PrintScan leveraged over a decade of experience providing fingerprinting services, and created a robust, user-friendly PrintScan Live Scan software program for in-house use. The success of this development and use of this system led to a demand by outside fingerprinting agencies, companies, and other businesses and individuals who had a need for the newest, state of the art Live Scan fingerprint program.
