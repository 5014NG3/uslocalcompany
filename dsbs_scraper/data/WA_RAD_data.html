Integrated heat-pump technology operates on a lower electrical draw than electric resistance heaters, saving generator owners up to 75% in energy and operational costs.","<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#103;&#119;&#97;&#108;&#116;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#64;&#104;&#111;&#116;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">gwalters@hotstart.com</a>","www.hotstart.com"
